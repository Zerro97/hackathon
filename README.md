This project is built during MadHacks 2019 Carbon, at UW Madison

## Description
This is a web application which helps students to post and share/sell unused goods to other users.

## Setup
You need to setup the project before running it in the browser.

### First Step
If you do not have node.js installed, install it from [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/).<br>
If you do not have nodemon installed, you need to install it globally (you can install it locally too) using npm. You can install by "npm install -g nodemon". If the permission is denied during installation, read the following [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47252451/permission-denied-when-installing-npm-modules-in-osx) by antzhrek

For IDE, I used visual studio code.

### Second Step
Git clone the repository to your local machine.

In the root directory (/hackathon), run "npm install". This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.<br>
In the backend directory (/hackathon/backend), run "npm install" again. 

## Running
It's time to run the web application!

First, in the backend directory, run "nodemon server". This will run server.js file and connnect the front end to our server. It will be at "localhost:5000"

Next, in the parent directory, run "npm start". This will start up the server and display the website in the browser. It will be at "localhost:3000"
